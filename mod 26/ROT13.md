ROT13 (short for "rotate by 13 places") is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces each letter in a message with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It is a type of Caesar cipher, which is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Here's how the ROT13 algorithm works:

Each letter in the alphabet is shifted 13 places forward.
For example, the letter 'A' becomes 'N', 'B' becomes 'O', 'C' becomes 'P', and so on.
Similarly, 'N' becomes 'A', 'O' becomes 'B', 'P' becomes 'C', and so forth.
Non-alphabetic characters such as spaces, punctuation, and numbers remain unchanged.
